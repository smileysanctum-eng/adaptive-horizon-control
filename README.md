# adaptive-horizon-control
Implements Jacobian-HMM control for DiFX on Google Distributed Cloud to predictively stabilize interferometric phases. By treating noise as structured states, we prevent decoherence before it occurs. An open standard for quantum-precision observation, empowering humanity to verify the truth essential for peace through knowledge.
